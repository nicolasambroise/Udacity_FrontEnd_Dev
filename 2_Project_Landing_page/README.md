## Description

In this project, you will be building a multi-section landing page. 
Often times, you won’t know how much content will be added to a page through a Content Management System (CSM) or an API. 
To handle this problem, you will dynamically add content to a web page. 
You’ll be building a landing page that combines your skills with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to update and control the page and create a dynamic user experience.

#### Landing Page Behavior
- Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.
- It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
- When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. 
You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. 
This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

#### Who to install it
No installation, it's only html files.
